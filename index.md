# About Me #

My name is Tom Sears and I consider myself a full-stack web developer -- where the
stack starts at bare metal. I was introduced to Q-Basic at 12 years old and
have been banging out code in one form or another ever since.  These days I do most
of my work with web technologies, but still duck over to the desktop or console when
I need to.

I&apos;ve spent most of my post-collegiate career working with Microsoft SharePoint as
a consultant - and not strictly in development activities. Estimating, infrastructure
setup, user documentation, project management and business analysis are all hats
I've worn at one point or another. On the tech side, most of my professional experience
centers around parts of the Microsoft stack. SharePoint uses ASP.NET (not MVC), html,
css, and javascript, but largely takes the place of the middle and back-end of the
web development stack in favor of its own rich object model and APIs.  For my more
recent projects, I've been favoring nodejs and express for application building.

As of late I have been transitioning away from SharePoint-related technologies in favor
of a more traditional full-stack web development role.

# Recent Projects #

## Node Weather ##

* [github](https://github.com/tsears/NodeWeather)

I decided to take my existing weather app (described below) and rebuild it in node / aws / react
as an exercise. This project is the backend portion comprised of the node application set up to
run as a lambda behind api gateway.

* javascript (es6)
* webpack
* AWS (cloudformation / lambda / api gateway)
* nodejs

## Game Of War ##

* [github](https://github.com/tsears/GameOfWar)
* [Demo Site](http://wargame.tsears.net)
* [github - Demo Site](https://github.com/tsears/GameOfWar-Site)

As part of a job interview I was tasked with developing an engine for playing the
card game [War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_%28card_game%29).  I decided if
I was going to do it, it may as well end up as a portfolio piece.  A companion site
was created to showcase some of the functionality - the ability to actually watch
a game being played is coming soonâ„¢!

* javascript (es6)
* Jasmine / Karma / PhantomJS
* webpack
* coverage / coveralls
* Travis CI
* Code Climate
* gulp
* Docker

## Weather ##
[http://weather.tsears.net](http://weather.tsears.net).  Source available on
[github](https://github.com/tsears/MVCWeather)

A clean, modern site for current weather and forecasts.  I built this over the course
of about a week to experiment with asp.net on linux through .net core.  I also wanted
to focus on design elements to get a clean look and feel.

* html
* css (sass/scss)
* javascript (es6)
* angular
* asp.net mvc / WebAPI
* gulp
* Jasmine / Karma / PhantomJS (angular unit testing)
* xunit (.net core unit testing)
* linux (ubuntu)
* nginx
* Vagrant
* git (github)
* Visual Studio Code
* Memcached

## Operation Breakdown ##
[https://www.operation-breakdown.com](https://www.operation-breakdown.com)

![Operation Breakdown on Laptop and Phone](/assets/images/opbd.png){:class="f-left" }

Operation Breakdown is a web-based repository for storing data gathered by parsing
replay files (called demos) provided by Valve from the game Counter Strike: Global
Offensive. The basic idea is that a parsing tool goes over the demo file compiling
statistics based on in-game events. The results of that parsing are submitted to
this site, where users will be able to review a detailed breakdown of their performance
during a match.

Operation Breakdown is the result of 8 months of part-time solo development, and
development continues to this day.  At the moment it is in a closed beta mode, though
the data is available for anyone to browse.

* html
* css (sass/scss)
* javascript
* angular
* node

* mongodb
* REST

[jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and hosted on github pages.

## Contact ##
[Source available on github](https://github.com/tsears/contact)

All of my projects incorporate some sort of flyout form that users can use to send
feedback or questions. I grew tired of duplicating the code to handle that, so I
created a microservice in nodejs specifically to handle the business of receiving
the data and sending me an email with the contents.

Cross Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) will be used so that I only need to run one
instance of the service without having to worry about cross-origin requests.

* nodejs
* es6
* nodeunit
* gulp
* git (github)
* microservice architecture
