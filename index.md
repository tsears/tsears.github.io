# About Me #

My name is Tom Sears and I consider myself a full-stack web developer, where the
stack starts at a pile of PC components and networking equipment. I was introduced
to Q-Basic in the 12 years old and have been banging out code in one form or another
ever since.  These days I do most of my work with web technologies, but still duck
over to the desktop or console when I need to.

I've spent most of my post-collegiate career working with Microsoft SharePoint as
a consultant -- and not strictly in development activities.  As such, most of my
professional experience centers around parts of the Microsoft stack. SharePoint
uses ASP.NET (not MVC), html, css, and javascript, but largely takes the place of
the middle and back-end of the web development stack in favor of its own rich object
model and APIs.

At this point I'm looking to move away from the consulting/CAD space and focus on
pure development on a product.

## Operation Breakdown ##

![Operation Breakdown on Laptop and Phone](/assets/images/opbd.png){:class="f-left" }

Operation Breakdown
is a web-based repository for storing data gathered by parsing demo files provided
by Valve from the game Counter Strike: Global Offensive. The basic idea is that a
parsing tool goes over the demo file compiling statistics based on in-game events.
The results of that parsing are submitted to this site, where users will be able
to review a detailed breakdown of their performance during a match.

Operation Breakdown is the results of 8 months of part-time solo development, and
development continues to this day.  At the moment it is in a closed beta mode, though
the data is available for anyone to browse.
