against the World Health Organization growth curves.  It&apos;s currently available at

One of the goals of this project was to build on the lessons learned during the
development of [Operation Breakdown](/Projects/Operation-Breakdown), so the stack
is very similar.  This allowed the project to be ramped up in a relatively short
amount of time. However for this project PostgreSQL replaced MongoDB, and es6
features were used - webpack and babel took care of transpiling.
