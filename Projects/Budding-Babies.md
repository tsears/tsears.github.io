Budding Babies is a site where parents can go to track the growth of their Babies
over time.  In addition to saving the raw values, it charts the various growth metrics
against the World Health Organization growth curves.  It's not available online
just yet, but will be launching soon.

One of the goals of this project was to build on the lessons learned during the
development of [Operation Breakdown](/Projects/Operation-Breakdown), so the stack
is very similar.  However for this project PostgreSQL replaced MongoDB, and es6
features were used - webpack and babel took care of transpiling.

* html
* css (sass/scss)
* javascript (es6)
* angular 1
* node
* express
* PostgreSQL
* REST
* gulp
* webpack / babel
