## Scope of Privacy Policy ##

This Privacy Policy applies to the information that we obtain through your use of
tsears.net via a Device or when you otherwise interact with tsears.net.

## Website Visitors ##

Like most website operators, tsears.net collects non-personally-identifying information
of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser
type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor
request. tsears.net’s purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information
is to better understand how tsears.net’s visitors use its website. From time to time,
tsears.net may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g.,
by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.

tsears.net also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet
Protocol (IP) addresses. tsears.net does not use such information to identify its
visitors, however, and does not disclose such information, other than under the same
circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information, as
described below.

## Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information ##

tsears.net will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying

access, use, alteration, or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and
personally-identifying information.

For instance, tsears.net may reveal how many visits a particular page received.

## Cookies ##

A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a visitor’s computer,
and that the visitor’s browser provides to the website each time the visitor returns.
tsears.net uses cookies to help tsears.net identify and track visitors, their usage
of tsears.net website, and their website access preferences. tsears.net visitors who
