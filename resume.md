## Fusorsoft ##

**May 2014 - Present**\\
*Software Engineer / CEO*\\
*[http://www.fusorsoft.com](http://www.fusorsoft.com)*


Fusorsoft is an entity I created a couple of years ago for performing consulting
and contract work.  While still available for that function, Fusorsoft has also
started producing web applications.

* A site for tracking the growth of babies against the World Health Organization
  growth charts. While also built using Node/Express/Angular, for this project I
  went with PostgreSQL for the storage tier.
* Built a web site for gathering, analyzing, and visualizing data collected from
  replay data of Counter Strike: Global Offensive. The site is built on a MEAN (mongo,
  express, angular, node) stack, while the parser is built using C#. [https://www.operation-breakdown.com](https://www.operation-breakdown.com) The
  site is still in closed beta phase and has only been released to select individuals.
* Wrote a tool using C# and LINQ for parsing a large HTML file with employment
  application information into smaller documents and routing those documents to
  an online library. The tool also extracted metadata from the applications and
  displayed it alongside the newly-created documents.
* A tool for synchronizing a spreadsheet full of user and location information into
  an online repository for a property management company based in Washington.  
  (C#, LINQ, HTML, CSS)
* Implemented responsive design elements for existing public website and intranet
  for a government client.  A particular challenge was ensuring the sites were
  functional while working around an Internet Explorer 8 requirement.
  (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, C#)

## Channelmatter ##

**June 2009 - February 2014**\\
*Software Developer*\\
*[http://www.channelmatter.com](http://www.channelmatter.com)*

### Custom Development ###

* Designed and implemented a Strategic Planning application for the Mississippi
  Community College Board.  It was a combination of a heavily customized InfoPath
  form, numerous event receivers, timer jobs, and user controls. (C#, InfoPath,
  XSLT, HTML, CSS, JavaScript)
* Developed a data collection and reporting solution for an energy company. It performed
  complex rollups from a hierarchical data structure with the goal of tracking safety
  metrics in various plants. (C#, HTML, CSS)
* Built an application for locating employee services within the same energy company.  
  Users are able to use a combination of Searching, Filtering, and an integrated map
  to find locations within the organization where various services are offered (e.g.
  video conferencing, I.D. badging, etc.) (JavaScript, REST, jQuery)
* Built a per-project financial reporting solution for the Kansas Department of
  Transportation using ASP.NET as a front end to a MS-SQL database.(C#, LINQ2SQL)
* Working as a subcontractor, applied branding to an intranet portal for a business
  unit within a large enterprise (JavaScript/jQuery, HTML, CSS).

### Public Websites ###
{: .pb }

#### Kansas Department for Children and Families ####
[http://www.dcf.ks.gov](http://www.dcf.ks.gov)

I was responsible for installation of the underlying CMS (Microsoft SharePoint),
as well as some light customization to facilitate the functionality of the Services
page.  The current site replaced another public site that Channelmatter also built.
I was brought back later to implement responsive elements to the design. Using Media
queries and a lot of jQuery, I was able to make the site reorganize itself to enhance
usability on mobile.

#### Kansas Self Directed Services and Individualized Planning ####
Site no longer available.

This is another public website sharing the same infrastructure as the DCF site.  
I was responsible for implementing a few features of interest.  Due to the nature
of the people this agency serves, the sites are required to pass strict accessibility
tests.

* A “What’s new” feature:  Whenever a page on the site was edited, the editor could
  optionally specify that the update would appear in the ‘What’s New’ section on
  the front page.
*	The “Rate This Page” feature: Site visitors were able to provide quick feedback
  about the relevance of the content.
* A feature for playing user-submitted videos: Users of Self-Directed services in
  Kansas were able to submit videos telling of their successes.  A video player
  connected to a Windows Media Server to play the video.

#### East Mississippi Community College ####
There isn’t much to this site from a technical standpoint, the primary challenge
was working with the college’s Director of Public Information, who came from a print
background and had no web experience whatsoever. With my help, she was able to take
over and successfully curate the content of the site for the last several years.

## Xerox ##
*October 2008 - June 2009*\\
*Software Tester*

Performed manual testing surrounding a function of Xerox copy machines that allows
for external software to interact with the machine (EIP).  Between test runs I built
a winforms application for managing test cases to replace existing excel-on-a-fileshare
approach.
